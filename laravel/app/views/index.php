                                    <p>It is the vision of the Company to become one of the world’s leading mobile application and game software developers within 5 years.</p>
                                    <p>The founding shareholders and management agree that AppBox Media can realistically anticipate to achieve £2.5 million in earnings in three years. Subject to market sentiment, they also agree that in three years’ time buyers could be found who would pay up to 10 times earnings for the Company. </p>
                                    <p>Therefore based on these assumptions, in three years the Company’s worth could be estimated at £25 million.</p>
                                    <p>The current market capitalisation AppBox Media Plc stands at £3.6 million.</p>

                                    <p>AppBox Media engages in one of the fastest growing sectors, at a time when the games industry is worth an estimated $80 billion worldwide.  This is approximately equal to the global film industry, and the biggest titles comfortably out earn blockbuster movies. The overall global app economy was worth $ 53Bn in 2012, and expected to rise to $ 68Bn in 2013 and forecast to appreciate to $ 143Bn in 2016.</p>
                                    <p>The US and China tower over the next group of top markets by way of countries with greatest number of active IOS  and Android devices by at least five times.  While the U.S. has added 55 million net active devices since October 2011, China has added 125 million, a figure that totals the sum of the UK, Japan and South Korea’s combined, current active user base.  China leads the world with an impressive 293% year-over-year growth rate, spurred by the potent combination of its vast population and rapidly growing middle class with plenty of opportunity to achieve further growth.</p>

                                    <p>EISs are a great tax-efficient way to invest in the new shares of small British businesses</p>
                                    <p>Investors who invest for a minimum period of three years benefit from 30 per cent tax relief as well as exemption from capital gains tax (CGT) and inheritance tax (IHT)</p>                                    
                                    <p>There are five current EIS tax reliefs available to investors in companies qualifying under the EIS, which are summarised below :</p>
                                    <p>1. Income tax relief</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>An individual with no more than a 30% interest in the company can reduce their income tax liability by up to 30% of the amount invested. An EIS qualifying investment must be held for no less than three years from the date of issue, or until three years from commencement of trade, if later.</li>
                                        <li>There is no minimum subscription per company and the maximum in respect of which a subscriber may obtain income tax relief in any year is £1m. </li>
                                        <li>Individuals may elect to treat their subscription for EIS shares, up to their maximum annual allowance, as if made in the previous tax year, thereby effectively carrying income tax relief back one year. In other words, up to £2m may be invested of which £1m could be applied to the previous tax year.</li>
                                        <li>Individuals each have an EIS allowance of £1m, so a married couple could invest up to £2m per tax year.</li>
                                        <li>Income Tax Relief is limited to the amount which reduces the individual's income tax liability for the year to nil. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br/>
                                        <p>2. Inheritance Tax Relief – ‘IHT’ Relief</p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Shares in EIS qualifying companies will generally qualify for Business Property Relief for Inheritance Tax purposes at rates of up to 100% after two years of holding such investment, so that any liability for Inheritance Tax is reduced or eliminated in respect of such shares. For a simple example of the impact of IHT relief. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <div id="toggler" style="display:none;">
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>3. CGT Freedom</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>No Capital Gains Tax is payable on the disposal of shares after three years, or three years after commencement of trade, if later, provided the EIS initial income tax relief was given and not withdrawn on those shares. However, the shares can be held for much longer, thus potentially permitting CGT free gain to accrue over a longer period. The opportunity for a CGT free gain can be an extremely valuable benefit from subscribing for shares in a successful EIS qualifying company. </li>
                                        </ul>                                    
                                        <br/>
                                        <p>4. CGT Deferral Relief</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Tax on capital gains realised on a different asset can be deferred for as long as the EIS qualifying shares are held or even indefinitely, where disposal of that asset was less than 36 months before the date of the issue of shares in the EIS investment or less than 12 months after it.</li>
                                            <li>Deferral relief is unlimited, in other words, this relief is not limited to investments of £1m per annum and can also be claimed by investors (individuals or trustees) whose interest in the company exceeds 30%. </li>

                                            <li>For losses offset against income, the net effect is to limit the investment exposure to 35p in the £1 for a 50% tax payer, if the shares were to become totally worthless.</li>
                                            <li>Alternatively the losses can be offset against Capital Gains at the prevailing rate 28% as applicable. </li>

                <p>Risks are attached to every kind of investment. Past performance should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of future performance, and no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made regarding future performance. The value of investments can go down as well as up and you may not get back the money you invested. Rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down. For your protection, telephone calls maybe recorded for monitoring purposes.</p>
                <p>Equity investments always carry some element of risk. Investments in unquoted companies should be considered higher risk investments than fully listed securities or shares. Investors should be prepared to take a medium to long term view on these types of investments. Investments that are not readily realisable (INRR), for example, shares issued by unquoted smaller companies involve a potentially higher degree of risk that all or part of your investment will be lost. You may have difficulty selling INRR at a reasonable price and in some cases it may be difficult to sell at any price. Similarly, it may prove difficult for you to obtain reliable information about the value of such an investment, or the risks to which it is exposed.</p>
